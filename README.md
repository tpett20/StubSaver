Welcome to StubSaver!

Remember a time back before every ticket to every event was online. Before you needed to charge your phone to ensure that you can get into your event as it needs to be scanned to get you through the gate? We do.

Remember when you'd have a corkboard, a shoebox or a wallet full of ticket stubs to your favourite events? Searching through them to unlock memories that were long since burried? We do.

Now, we have worked together to recreate that experience virtually, with StubSaver!

First, you will need to log into our web application. From here you'll be taken to your main page that displays your tickets. If this is your first time logging in, the page itself will be empty.

Then, you will need to select "Add Ticket". This will be where all of your logged tickets will be stored. The "Add Ticket" function will allow you to update your profile with a ticket to an event that you went to.

The basic data we want you to input is as follows:
- Name: a title for your event. This could be anything you want to describe the event. for example "Beyonce world tour" or "final game of season"
- Date: in the format YEAR-MONTH-DAY
- Location: selected from a drop down menu of Locations you have saved
- Companion: Who did you go with? put their name(s) here!
- Event type: Currently two options, Sport or Concert.

If you select sport event, you'll be taken to a seperate page to privde further details of that sporting event.
Game Details

Sport: What sport did you see? Football? Baseball? Hockey?
- League: What league was being played?
- Home Team: Who was the home team?
- Away Team: Who was the away team?
- Home Score: What was the score of the home team?
- Away Score: What was the score of the away team?

Once submitted, the form will be removed and replaced with your inputted details.

On the side of the page, you have the option to add highlights.
- Your Highlights: In here input as much information as you want about your experience. How were your seats? how was the weather? did something special happen?
- Video URL: Is there a youtube(or other video service) highlight of your event? add it in so you can re live your memories

You're able to add multiple highlights, maybe you took your own videos and want them to be added? host them on a video service and add the link!

Head back to "all tickets" and you will see a card with your ticket. If it's a sporting event it will have an image of some well cut grass.

If it's a concert however it'll be a picture of Chris Martin!

Want to add a location? Select "Add Location" from the nav bar.

We're asking for specific information for this. We beleive that the location can sometimes be as important as the event (I'm looking at you, Madison Square Garden).
- Name: The name of the venue
- City: The city of the venue
- Country: The country of the venue
- Maps URL: We reccomend google maps, but any maps url should be inputted here.

Once submitted, you'll see the card for your newly added location.

Head back to the ticket you just made. On the original details page it advises that "Location: Not Specified". Select "Edit" and it will bring you back to the edit page and you can add your newly created location.

If you create a concert, the details page will be different. You can still add highlights and the location, however instead of the sporting result, you're able to add and create an artist.

To create an artist, simply add their name to the "Add An Artist" form and click add artist.

They will be generate and select the green "Add" button to add them to the event!

Further scope on this project includes features such as:
- Be able to tag your friends in events you go to
- Embed youtube highlights of your event to relive it at a future date
- expand the scope of possible tickets (i.e cinema, plays, lectures, travel)
- Upload your own images to the event (a picture speaks 1000 words)
- google maps inbuilt functionality for venues

Thank you for using StubSaver!
