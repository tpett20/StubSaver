Welcom to StubSaver! 

Remeber a time back before every ticket to every event was online. Before you needed to charge your phone to ensure that you can get into your event as it needs to be scanned to get you through the gate? We do.

Remember when you'd have a corkboard, a shoebox or a wallet full of ticket stubs to your favourite events? Searching through them to unlock memories that were long since burried? We do.

Now, we have worked together to recreate that experience virtually, with StubSaver!

First, you will need to log into our web application. From here you'll be taken to your main page. If this is your first time logging in, the page itself will be empty.

Then, you will need to select "All Tickets". This will be where all of your logged tickets will be stored. The "Add Tickets" function will allow you to update your profile with a ticket to an event that you went to.

If it's a sports event, you can include details such as Home Team, Away Team, Score and Location. If it's a concert you went to, save who the support acts were, what genre your artist performed and where you went to see them. Don't forget to include a description of how your day went. Feel free to include anything like how good your seats were, how loud the crowd were, who scored and what the weather was like.

Once you have filled out this information, head back to your log in page. From here you will start to see your profile taking shape. We will include stats such as which artists you've seen the most, which sports team always wins when you go see them and what venue you frequent the most!

Further scope on this project includes features such as:
- Be able to tag your friends in events you go to
- Embed youtube highlights of your event to relive it at a future date
- expand the scope of possible tickets (i.e cinema, plays, lectures)
- Upload your own images to the event (a picture speaks 1000 words)
- google maps inbuilt functionality for venues


Thank you for using StubSaver!
